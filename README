--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CCMD (Coulomb Crystal Molecular Dynamics) code provides a framework for performing molecular dynamics simulations of trapped ion clouds. 

Requirements (for complete functionality):

Qt/QtSDK
Boost
CUDA library
CUDA SDK

**********
Compiling
**********

Linux:
------
Running make in src/ compliles the static library libccmd.a in bin/linux
Test programs can be compiled by running make in the Examples/ directory
Executables are found in bin/linux

Mac OS X:
---------
